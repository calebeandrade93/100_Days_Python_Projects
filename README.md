# 100 Days Python Projects :snake:
 
- Hi everyone, basically I've joined all the cool projects that I've done so far in this challenge into one file to keep it organised :slightly_smiling_face:.
- In this text file I'm gonna comment about the projects from the most recent one that I've uploaded to the oldest.

## Turtle Crossing :turtle:
- I built this game based on the famous "Crossing Road"
- There iare 15 levels which will be kinda impossible you cross the road at level 15... But if you lucky try it out !

## Pong Game
- A classical arcade game
- There is few things I might come back to change in the future like the interface and the ball's speed.

## Snake Game :snake:
- A classical arcade snake game.

## Turtle Race
- 5 turtles racing against each other you never know who's gonna win, make your bet ! 

## Hirst Painting :paintbrush:
- This project was based on the Damien Hirst's spot painting which was sold by over 1.000.000,00 pounds, crazy isn't it ?
- I used turtle package to create an object "turtle" called alex and Screen to display the painting.
- Also I've imported the colorgram package which extract a color from the image and returns as list.

## Quizz OOP
- This project is where I started to learn about objects. Actually it's my very first OOP project :grin:.
- The program itself is a quiz game that has 12 questions and a score.

## Coffee Machine :coffee:
- This is one of my favorites projects I've spent some time on it to make it more interactive for the user, it's simples but I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
- Basically it's divided in three files - one for arts, data and main. All the logic I wrote in the data, where there is a dictionary with all the needs to make a coffee.
- Also there is a report which will update whenver it runs out of coffee beans, milk or water.

## Guessing Number
- A simple guessing number game that you have to guess between 1 to 100.
- It has two levels of difficulty - Easy and Hard level - Where Easy you have 10 credits to guess the number and Hard you have 5 credits to guess the number.

## Hangman
- My very first Python project.
- It's a simple hangman game with cool arts to make it more interactive :blush:.
